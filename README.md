ONDC's logistics app uses a modern technical stack for web, mobile and server-side development. The client layer is served as two applications.
The first serves the Admin console for monitoring and managing the LSP web application.
The second serves the Driver application which is monitored as a PWA web application accessible on any web enabled device screen.

The consoles are built on ReactJS v17 for management of the application layer. The backend of the application is built on the NodeJS v16 runtime, hosted on various docker containers.

The database used for application data storage is MongoDB with Mongoose ORM for querying and mutations.

A RabbitMQ Service container is used as the system bus for passing events and messages between various services.

This repo is ONDC logistics App is developed with microservice architecture
which contains

- protocol layer(python)
- client API layer (node js)
- front app(react) being served via nginx
- ancillary API (python) - flask apis
composed together with docker-compose.yaml

## For Whom

- wants to refer the logistics app
- wants the same setup to be available in their infra
- pick any component of it and use separately
- know the bare minimum structure to add and modify their own application

## Installation

1. Clone the git Repository

```bash
    git clone <url>
```

2. Make sure you've pulled all sub-directories .

```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --remote --recursive
```

3. Copy environment variables from env.example file to env.local

```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Run docker command to start the logistics application

```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-for-local.yaml --env-file .env.local up -d 
```

## Environment Variables

To get Environment Variables, Registration is required to access certain services.

### Server-side environment

**A. Protocol Web Server**
The protocol web server is the service communicating with the network. This service is running as its own container and requires the following keys.

```
BPP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${BPP_PRIVATE_KEY}
BPP_PUBLIC_KEY: ${BPP_PUBLIC_KEY}
BPP_UNIQUE_KEY_ID: ${BPP_UNIQUE_KEY_ID}
BPP_ID: ${BPP_ID}
```

Alongside these the protocol storage are using a postgres instance which require the following keys.

```
PG_HOST: ${PG_HOST}
PG_PORT: ${PG_PORT}
PG_DATABASE: ${PG_DATABASE}
PG_USER: ${PG_USER}
PG_PASSWORD: ${PG_PASSWORD}
```

The consumer end of the service has all the above keys with an additional key for identification of the consumer endpoint.

```
BPP_CLIENT_ENDPOINT: ${BPP_CLIENT_ENDPOINT}
```

**B. Google SMTP Service**
For mailing and invites to admins and delivery agents, we are using the GoogleSMTP service. The developer using this repository can select their own mailing service.

```
SMTP_HOST: ${SMTP_HOST}
SMTP_PORT: ${SMTP_PORT}
SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME: ${SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME}
SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD: ${SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD}
SMTP_EMAIL_SENDER: ${SMTP_EMAIL_SENDER}
SMTP_EXCEPTION_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS: ${SMTP_EXCEPTION_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS}
```

For receiving notifications as a super-admin we need to set a mail id in the environment for all events occuring in the web application.

```
LOGISTICS_ADMIN_EMAIL: ${LOGISTICS_ADMIN_EMAIL}
```

**D. S3 Bucket credentials with AWS access key**
S3 Bucket for storage of images uploaded by the delivery agent for confirmations at different parts of the delivery journey.

```
S3_ACCESS_KEY=${S3_ACCESS_KEY}
S3_SECRET_KEY=${S3_SECRET_KEY}
S3_BUCKET=${S3_BUCKET}
S3_REGION=${S3_REGION}
S3_VERSION=${S3_VERSION}
```

**E. MapMyIndia API keys(Optional)**
MapMyIndia (will be used in the future) for all positioning and location related details.

- Onboarding agent for home location
- Locating agent in deliveries
- Locating pickup and drop locations

```
MMI_CLIENT_ID: ${MMI_CLIENT_ID}
MMI_CLIENT_SECRET: ${MMI_CLIENT_SECRET}
MMI_ADVANCE_API_KEY: ${MMI_ADVANCE_API_KEY}
```

**F. Grafana Service (optional)**
An optional monitoring service can be used to look at the call structures for all the calls taking place on the network. For Grafana, please start the service and place the following keys in the environment. Grafana Loki can be used for aggregating logs from the application.

```
LOKI_HOST: ${LOKI_HOST}
```

### Client-side Environment

The client is kept as light as possible, shifting all computational load to the server. For this reason the react client only requires the following keys.

```
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=${BASE_URL for react application}
REACT_APP_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=${Allowed domains for the backend server}
REACT_APP_MASTER_EMAIL=${The master email should be an admin email for which the password cannot be changed(optional)}
```

```bash
{
    "country": "IND",
    "city": "*",
    "type": "BPP",
    "subscriber_id": "YOUR_HOSTED_DOMAIN",
    "subscriber_url": "YOUR_API_ENDPOINT",
    "domain": "nic2004:60232",
    "signing_public_key": "SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY",
    "encr_public_key": "CRYPTO_PUBLICKEY",

(The date format is OpenAPI date-time notation)

```BPP_PRIVATE_KEY=``` This will be ```SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY``` generated by the [utility](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/reference-implementations/tree/main/utilities/signing_and_verification).

```BPP_PUBLIC_KEY=```This will be ```SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY```

```BPP_UNIQUE_KEY_ID=```  This will be ukId which we will get after subscribing.

```BPP_ID=``` This will be the ```HOSTED_DOMAIN```that you are sharing in the payload as the value of subscriber_id.

```

# Running the application for the first time

After following the steps in setting up the application and setting all the environment variables correctly, we can access the client admin application on the on the node localhost serving the application.

On the first access to the frontend, the developer will encounter the following screens.
